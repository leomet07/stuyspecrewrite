#

The **new** client-side application of The Stuyvesant Spectator, built using various modern technologies including NextJS, Typescript, and MongoDB

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/stuyspec/stuyspec-rewrite.git
```

2. Install all dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

3. Set up the `.env.local`
   Create a `.env.local` file, with MONGODB_URI being the credentials for your development mongodb database

```bash
# In .env.local
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://...
```

4. Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page hot reloads as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/articles](http://localhost:3000/api/articles). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/articles/index.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Running this app with docker

Build the app with docker.

```bash
docker build -t stuyspecrewrite .
```

Next, run the built container.

```bash
docker run -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 stuyspecrewrite
```
